            <div class = "overlay">
                Queen is my all-time favorite band. I have seen them in concert (sadly without Freddie Mercury) 
                and have all of their albums on vinyl.<br><br>
                My favorite songs by them are: "Bohemian Rhapsody, Don't Stop 
                Me Now, '39, Play the Game, You and I, and Love of my Life".

            <div class = "overlay">
                Another classic band I love is The Beatles. Since I was little, I have appreciated their music. 
                The first song I learned on guitar was Blackbird! <br><br>
                My favorite songs by them are: "Blackbird, I Want To Hold Your Hand, All My Loving, I Will, and Boys".
