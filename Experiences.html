        <p>I was selected as 1 of 45 out of 500+ applicates to complete a semester-long 
            training program where I developed ksills in Git/Github, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

        <h3>Charm-a-hoop</h3>
        <h4>Role: Founder and Vice President</h4>
        <p>With a group of friends, I co-founded a local company based in Towson, MD 
            that sold a variety of gold charm earrings. As vice president, I oversaw the 
            company's finance, production, and marketing departments. I also set up and 
            ran the website, our main form of sales. In it's short run, Charm-a-hoop was 
            very sucessful making over $4000 in revenue and donating a portion of our proceeds 
            to the House of Ruth charity organization.
