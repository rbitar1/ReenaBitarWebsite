        <h3>Music</h3>
        <br>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies since I was a child is playing the piano. I have been playing the piano
            since I was 4 years old and have performed in many recitals and even been part of a band. 
            I love playing pop, rock, jazz, and movie soundtrack music. I find playing the piano to be 
            very relaxing and a great way to express myself. The summer after 11th grade, I decided to teach myself
            how to play the guitar. I have always loved how the guitar sounds and how portable it is. I also love to sing.
            Since elementary school, I have been a part of many chorus' and shows and have loved every second.

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I love food. Whether it is cooking up a new recipie or trying out a new resturant in town, I am always
            excited to try new foods. I love to try out new foods and see how different cultures prepare their food. 
            I have been to many resturants in the Baltimore area and have loved every second.

        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Traveling is one of my favorite things to do. I love to see new places, try new foods, and meet new people. 
            I have been to many different countries and each one has its own unique culture and charm. I enjoy exploring new cultures,
             relaxing on beautiful beaches, and experiencing the local cuisine. I also love taking pictures and traveling has allowed 
             me to take some of my favorites. Traveling allows me to broaden my horizons and gain new perspectives on life.
